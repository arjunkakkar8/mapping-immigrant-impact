          Immigration in the United States has become highly politicized. For
          every story that spotlights an immigrant entrepreneur, doctor, or
          teacher who is helping revitalize their community, one can find
          another that paints immigrants as scapegoats for economic woes.
          Although these negative anecdotes may do little to sway an already
          self-proclaimed immigrant advocate, it can leave many of its unversed
          readers confused about what national narrative they should be
          supporting.
          <br /><br />
          By analyzing the proportional economic contributions of immigrants in
          their local communities, we can compare their impact and give a more
          comprehensive picture of their contributions across the country.
          <br /><br />
          We show that more often than not, immigrants are making outstanding
          contributions. However, not all immigrants are contributing at the
          same levels across the country.
          <br /><br />
          National disparities in contributions do not say anything inherent
          about the immigrants’ propensity to contribute. In fact, instances of
          under-contribution are often in constant flux and geographically
          clustered. We hope that highlighting these disparities across regions,
          states and metropolitan areas will illuminate how political
          environments and structures may be helping uplift some immigrant
          communities while limiting others.
        </div>
        <div class="textbox text step">
          We have constructed a metric that measures the impact immigrants have
          on their local economies. It is composed of three key indicator values
          for immigrants as a proportion of values for the local community
          (PUMA) they reside in:
          <span style="font-weight: bold;"
            >tax contributions, entrepreneurship</span
          >
          and
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">participation in key industries</span
          >. Let's take a look at this metric for 2012. <br /><br />
          On this map,
          <span style="font-weight: bold;color:rgb(0, 117, 137)">blue</span>
          indicates PUMAs that fostered significant immigrant contributions to
          their local economy,
          <span style="font-weight: bold;color:rgb(163, 163, 163)">white</span>
          indicates standard PUMAs where immigrants contributed at par with
          their share of the population and
          <span style="font-weight: bold;color:rgb(201, 162, 37)">yellow</span>
          indicates PUMAs where immigrant contributions were under-utilized.
        </div>
        <div class="spacer"></div>
        <div class="textbox text step">
          We visualize the PUMAs in which immigrant contributions are
          significantly different from the expected value in the dot plot below.
          The dots are sized according to the number of immigrants in the PUMA
          and are colored according to the impact score of immigrants in those
          communities.
        </div>
        <div class="spacer"></div>
        <div class="textbox text">
          Using our Immigrant Impact Metric we can see that
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">87%</span> of immigrants live in
          PUMAs that are either fostering increased contributions or maintaining
          proportional immigrant economic contributions to the local economy.
          <br /><br />
          Moreover, immigrants are nationally overrepresented in PUMAs where
          they are making
          <span style="font-style: italic;">outsize contributions</span>!
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">26.9%</span> of the immigrant
          population lives in fostering PUMAs &mdash; which make up only
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">17.9%</span>
          of the total PUMAs in the country.
        </div>
        <div class="spacer"></div>
        <div class="step">
          <div class="textbox text">
            It’s clear from the dot plot that not all PUMAs have the same share
            of immigrants. In this sense, the map can actually be misleading
            since larger PUMAs (regardless of their immigrant population) draw
            more attention.<br /><br />
            To give you some perspective on where immigrants live in the US,
            let’s quickly scale states by their immigrant populations.
            <br /><br />
            For the sake of clarity we'll continue with the regular map but it’s
            important to keep in mind that PUMA size isn’t representative of the
            immigrant population and their relative impact.

          To better understand regional trends in immigrant contributions, lets
          smooth out this map and take a look at regional hotspots.

        Across time, the overall proportional breakdown of immigrant economic
        impact remains pretty consistent. PUMAs that foster immigrants are more
        common and hold consistently larger immigrant populations than those
        that under-utilize them.

          However, there are some clear regional hotspots that need further
          exploration. Let's take a look at these regions in more detail with
          2017 data.

        <div class="spacer"></div>
        <div class="text textbox">
          We divide the US into 5 major regions and rank them by their share of
          fostering PUMAs. The Southwest ranks first with both the largest share
          of fostering PUMAs and the smallest share of under-utilizing PUMAs. In
          other words, 92.6% of its PUMAs are either standard or fostering
          PUMAs.

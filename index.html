          Immigration in the United States has become highly politicized. For
          every story that spotlights an immigrant entrepreneur, doctor, or
          teacher who is helping revitalize their community, one can find
          another that paints immigrants as scapegoats for economic woes.
          Although these negative anecdotes may do little to sway an already
          self-proclaimed immigrant advocate, it can leave many of its unversed
          readers confused about what national narrative they should be
          supporting.
          <br /><br />
          By analyzing the proportional economic contributions of immigrants in
          their local communities, we can compare their impact and give a more
          comprehensive picture of their contributions across the country.
          <br /><br />
          We show that more often than not, immigrants are making outstanding
          contributions. However, not all immigrants are contributing at the
          same levels across the country.
          <br /><br />
          National disparities in contributions do not say anything inherent
          about the immigrantsâ€™ propensity to contribute. In fact, instances of
          under-contribution are often in constant flux and geographically
          clustered. We hope that highlighting these disparities across regions,
          states and metropolitan areas will illuminate how political
          environments and structures may be helping uplift some immigrant
          communities while limiting others.

        <div class="textbox text step">
          We have constructed a metric that measures the impact immigrants have
          on their local economies. It is composed of three key indicator values
          for immigrants as a proportion of values for the local community
          (PUMA) they reside in:
          <span style="font-weight: bold;"
            >tax contributions, entrepreneurship</span
          >
          and
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">participation in key industries</span
          >. Let's take a look at this metric for 2012. <br /><br />
          On this map,
          <span style="font-weight: bold;color:rgb(0, 117, 137)">blue</span>
          indicates PUMAs where immigrants significantly over-contributed to
          their local economy,
          <span style="font-weight: bold;color:rgb(163, 163, 163)">white</span>
          indicates PUMAs where immigrants contributed at par with their share
          of the population and
          <span style="font-weight: bold;color:rgb(201, 162, 37)">yellow</span>
          indicates PUMAs where immigrants under-contributed.
        </div>
        <div class="spacer"></div>
        <div class="textbox text step">
          We visualize the PUMAs in which immigrant contributions are
          significantly different from the expected value in the dot plot below.
          The dots are sized according to the number of immigrants in the PUMA
          and are colored according to the impact score of immigrants in those
          communities.
        </div>
        <div class="spacer"></div>
        <div class="textbox text">
          Using our Immigrant Impact Metric we can see that
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">87%</span> of immigrants live in
          PUMAs where they are over-contributing or equally contributing to the
          economy. <br /><br />
          Moreover, immigrants are nationally overrepresented in PUMAs where
          they are making
          <span style="font-style: italic;">outsize contributions</span>!
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">26.9%</span> of the immigrant
          population lives in over-contributing PUMAs- which make up only
          <span style="font-weight: bold;">17.9%</span>
          of the total PUMAs in the country.

          <div class="textbox text">
            Note that the immigrant populations living in each state vary quite
            significantly. Here's a quick flash of the map with states sized by
            their immigrant populations. For the sake of clarity we'll continue
            with the regular map but keep in mind the size of immigrant
            populations while considering their impact.

          To better understand regional trends in immigrant contributions, lets
          smooth out this map and take a look at regional hotspots.
